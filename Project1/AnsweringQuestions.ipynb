      "Also, I think broadening the area of which the detectors were spread would help too. Although this goes hand in hand with adding more detectors. Also, the only way I could find to solve the linear set of equations was to solve as a square matrix. You only need 3 equations to solve for 3 variables, but I believe solving for the set of all equations made from the multilateration equation I found on wikipedia. I am to believe that it makes a close guess if an actual solution isn't available.\n",
